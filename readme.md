# 2D Robot CLI

## How to Install and run
You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine to run the CLI.

To install testing requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run tests:

```
pytest
```


To run the application:

```
python cli.py
```

This will open a CLI where you can give basic commands to your robot(s) to move them 
around a virtual grid.
